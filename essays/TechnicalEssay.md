## Fuel
I've always been deeply fascinated by the inner workings of websites, programs, and applications. The effort involved in front-end and back-end development can be quite daunting, especially considering the thousands of apps uploaded to the app store and the constant creation of new websites and programs by numerous developers. The entire development process feels like an ongoing battle with your mind. Spending hours solving compile errors or fixing functions that aren't working properly can be challenging, but that "eureka" moment and the rush of dopamine that follows make it all worthwhile. I've always loved that sense of accomplishment and enjoy seeing the fruits of my labor come to life. Therefore, my interests lie in creating challenging projects that not only push my limits but also have meaningful purposes.

## Goals
I hope to develop innovative solutions that impact a wide range of people, providing not only practical needs but also a sense of joy and ease. To achieve my end goal, I aim to learn and become proficient in various languages, toolsets, and critical thinking skills. One notable experience I had was participating in a cyber defense competition for ACM GreyHats. Although not software engineering-based, it was an excellent learning experience for developing critical thinking and teamwork skills. The feeling of euphoria after completing all the tasks fueled my desire for accomplishment and self-pride, which I hope to experience repeatedly in software engineering.

## Prospects for the future
While this class is only four months long, I aspire to emerge with invaluable experience and knowledge that I can continue to utilize and develop throughout my career. I am committed to learning and growing in this dynamic field, striving to create solutions that not only solve problems but also bring joy and convenience to people's lives. I eagerly anticipate the opportunities ahead, excited to collaborate and contribute to a tech-driven future that enhances our daily experiences.
