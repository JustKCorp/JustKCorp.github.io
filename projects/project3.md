summary: "A simple shape calculator that finds the area given the dimensions as input."
---

This program defines a hierarchy of classes for various shapes such as Circle, Square,
Sphere, Cylinder, Cube, Triangle, and Tetrahedron. Each class defines functions to calculate the 
area and volume of the corresponding shape. The base class, Shape, provides virtual functions 
for getting the name of the shape, printing its details, and taking input data. Each derived class 
overrides the base class functions to provide their own implementation.
