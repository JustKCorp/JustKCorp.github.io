summary: "Participated with a group of friends to compete in a Valorant tournament at KawaiiKon"
---
My friends and I decided to make sign up for a valorant tournament at a local convention called KawaiiKon. We went into it with the idea of getting to have a friendly competition with others and make some memories. We somehow ended up in the finals for the tournament and found ourselves in the finals, competing against UH Esports very own Valorant team. In the end we got 2nd place against them and made countless memories from this experience. This was in 2021. in 2022 we decided to sign up again and ended up playing against the UH Esports team again. Just like last time we finished with 2nd place. However, the overall experience was second to none.
