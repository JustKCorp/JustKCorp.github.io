summary: "Participated with a group of friends to compete in a Valorant tournament at KawaiiKon"
---
My friends and I decided to sign up for a Valorant tournament at a local convention called KawaiiKon. We approached it with the idea of engaging in a friendly competition with others and creating lasting memories. Surprisingly, we advanced to the finals and found ourselves competing against the UH Esports Valorant team. Ultimately, we secured the 2nd place spot against them, making numerous memories along the way. This occurred in 2021. In 2022, we opted to participate again and once more faced off against the UH Esports team. Similar to the previous year, we finished in 2nd place. However, the overall experience was second to none.
